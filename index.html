						<h3>Schooling:</h3>
						Dennis Ritchie graduated from Summit High School following which he then
						attended and graduated from Harvard in both Physics and Applied Mathematics
						1963 and following it up with a PhD Mathematics five years later.
						</p>
						<p>
						<h3>Career:</h3>
						Ritchie started at Bell Labs in 1967 a research division of the American
						Telephone and Telegraphy Company. This company went through numerous changes
						in name and ownership. However in Ritchie's own words,
						<blockquote>	"Bell Labs has remained
						a remarkably good place to do work that has enduring impact over the long run,
						no matter what they compnay, the courts the PR types or upper management
						decided should be our name and logo on a given day or year."</blockquote>
						</p>

						<h3>Accomplishments:</h3>
						<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>The C programming language</h4>
						Of the two greats achievements of Dennis Ritchie the first was the C
						programming language. Many in this day and age of Object Orientied programming
						and virtual machines dismiss the C programming language as a primitive
						unwieldy levithan, best suited for the days of the Roman Colissieum and
						Stonehenge. What these pompus jack wagons fail to understand is that there was
						a time in computing before we had the luxury of abstractions, and automatic
						garbage collection, that there was a time when as programmers we had to work
						with raw pointers and memory allocation. C is like the P-51 Mustang or the
						Tommy Gun, if they were to be matched against the weapons of today they
						wouldn't be able to hold their own for 20 seconds, but they were solid
						reliable, and they were used by the men that saved the world from darkness.
						Thats what C was, a cross platform language, that could compile on multiple
						architectures, a language that provided some abstraction beyond mnemonics for
						raw machine instructions. Every major modern language dervies its syntax and
						structure from C, it is the grandfather of all major languages. Without C
						there would have been no JavaScript, Java, Python, or C++. Without C we
						would've been stuck with Pascal or BASIC as the progenitor to the languages we
						use know today. All of this works comes because of the work of Ken Thompson
						and Dennis Ritchie.
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>The Unix Operating System</h4>
						With just the C programming language under his belt Dennis Ritchie would earn
						his place among the annals of great programmers; however his other great
						accomplishemnt, the creation of the Unix Operating System. The Unix Operating
						System is the mostly widely used operating system in the world today. It runs
						the servers that power the worlds most used websites, the mobile devices
						carried in people's pocket, the devices that run the internet backbone, all
						derivied from the Unix operating system. If there were no Dennis Ritchie and
						no Unix OS the only major player in the OS game would be Microsoft, imagine a
						world with Windows ruling as the undisputed lord or all personal computing
						devices. The operating system that powers the Apple watch, and the Google
						servers, all derivatives of Unix. 
						</li>
						</ul>
						</p>

						In conclusion Dennis Ritchie is a hero of the modern age, the herald of the
						future, the pioneer of the information age. We are who we are today because we
						stand on the shoulders of giants, and one of the greatest is Dennis Rictchie.
